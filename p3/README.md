# Project 3

## Game planning
I didn't have a very particular game plan on this project, since I had already completed the higher/lower
logic in P2. I (stupidly!) expected to only have to move around a few things and add a small process.php file to account for the fact that the game has multiple rounds of input. I approached every problem as I went, tacking one at a time. I don't think I could have planned out the steps beforehand, I really needed to be in the middle of a problem to think of a solution, and this isn't optimal, so I should aim to "improve" my pseudocode.

## Notes for instructor
I had a lot of trouble dealing with scope, not quite knowing when and where a 
variable would be accessible and similar issues to that. I have quite a few declarations
of variables that are just passed ```null``` to get rid of the errors I was getting, is this 
okay to do? I have also had a lot of difficulties writing the PHP that renders the HTML
in my .index file. How could I have better written the logic in my .index file?

## Outside resources
[CSS for the radio buttons](https://markheath.net/post/customize-radio-button-css)

## Notes for instructor
The provided ```/css/app.css``` style sheet would not work for me, despite seeming to be linked
properly. I created a new CSS file named ```style.css``` and replaced the file name in the stylesheet
link tag, and style.css worked properly. I'm not sure why this was happening.

**UPDATE:** I checked my production link on mobile and it seems that app.css was actually working, 
somewhy it wasn't working properly on my PC's browser. Still unsure of what's going on.
